        <h3>Bike News</h3>
        <p class="largetext">
        Most name brand bikes sold today, including some brands which we sell from our site 
        and our shop are outsourced from a few large factories in Asia. So what, then, makes 
        the difference? The hands do. Almost every day I am asked these two questions: 
        <ol>
            <li>Why do you sell only Raleighbikes, and</li>
            <li>Why should I buy a bike from you and not from Mega Mart?</li>
        </ol>The answer to the first question is that all of the big brand name bikes are 
        the same. They are all the same. Sorry to burst your bubble, but these companies just 
        source their bikes from big manufacturers all over the world. I found a site that 
        shows where they all come from, take a peek at <a>Who made my Bike?</a> An article I 
        found and copy to my website.<br/>&emsp;I choose Raleigh because they are less 
        expensive. Because Raleigh does not advertise, their prices are lower. The big four 
        companies advertise heavily, so their prices are higher. It is not magic; it is just 
        good business.<br/>&emsp;The answer to the second question (the one about the Mega Mart) 
        is a whole different story. I will try to minimize my ranting about these bikes, but the 
        truth is that these questions evoke lengthy responses. I understand buying a toy car 
        from these Mega Mart places. Your little angel goes into his/her room and safely 
        plays with it. Or maybe you buy them a small airplane and they go out in the yard and 
        toss it up into the air. What I cannot get past is the part where you would allow your 
        child to ride a bicycle from a Mega Mart in the street alongside a 4000 pound 
        all-wheel-drive vehicle driven by a distracted person talking on a cell phone. There is 
        more than one thing wrong with this picture. First of all, this Mega Mart Bike is the 
        cheapest thing that a fat, cigar-smoking suit can get his hands on. Secondly, the bike 
        was assembled by a kid with no proper tools or training. Then to add insult to any person 
        that has dedicated their life to proper, safe assemblage of bikes, the owner of the Mega 
        Mart bike brings it into the shop for service only to get angry at me for pointing out 
        that the bike is not safe, is falling apart, and will need extensive repair work.<br/>&emsp;
        A bike built by a talented mechanic is in fact greater than the sum of its parts. The 
        fact is that most shops and mail-order companies try to maximize profits by skimping 
        out on the quality of assemblies and repairs. We, however, have Steve Willis. Steve 
        is a veteran bike mechanic and former racer who has been building, racing, and loving 
        bikes since the early seventies. For those of you who are wondering why you should buy a 
        bike at a shop instead of a Mega Mart-type-store, take a look at this <a>comparison of a 
        mountain bike</a> page or <a>comparison of a child's bike</a>. Thank you.<br/>&emsp;We are 
        putting together an E-Newsletter. If you would like to get 
        regular updates and special offers on labor or parts sent right to your computer, click 
        on this link <a>E-Newsletter</a>. <br/>&emsp;Come visit our Miscellaneous Mechanical 
        Ramblings. I will be posting problems and events that have happened here at The Bike Stand 
        with some answers and insights to what we did to solve the problem with out getting too 
        preachy in the meantime. I will be updating these from time to time. If anything I mention 
        on the page seems to pertain to any problem you are having, feel free to email me at The Bike 
        Stand <a href="mailto:smwillis@verizon.net" target="_blank">smwillis@verizon.net<a/>.<br/>&emsp;When you get a 
        chance, take a look at the assembly page and take a look at your bike. Pull out the brake cable 
        pinch bolt and see if there is any grease on it. If not, take some time to go over your bike 
        or bring it down for me to go over it with you.<br/>&emsp;I have been in this field for a little 
        over thirty years now so, as you can guess, I have acquired a lot of NOS and used older bikes 
        and bike parts. I started to list some of the older parts we have under the heading <a>Vintage<a/>. 
        Feel free to email me with any needs you have, and I may have the answer. Keep checking back. 
        I will be adding to the list every few days or so, and if you have some free time take a 
        look at the new page of component <a>weights<a/>.<br/>&emsp;We are trying something 
        different here. Quality labor has a value. I will try and do it right or not do it at all.
